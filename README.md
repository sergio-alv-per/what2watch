# What2Watch

What2Watch is a simple web app to help you choose what film to watch with your friends. Create a room (_please be patient, it can take a while_), then share the room ID with your friends. Then, swipe away and you will be notified when all of your friends swipe right on the same film!

This is a simple project I developed in order to learn some web development technologies, specifically React, Vite, Tailwind and FastAPI.
